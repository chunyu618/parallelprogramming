\section{Motivation} 
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Parallel Computing?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Solve a problem faster.
\item Solve a problem better.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Olympic Games} The modern Olympic Games are the leading
international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports
competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world
participate in a variety of
competitions.\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games}}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Olympic Motto}
The Olympic motto, Citius, Altius, Fortius, a Latin expression meaning
``Faster, Higher, Stronger'' was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin in
1894 and has been official since 1924.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Faster}
\begin{itemize}
\item The reigning 100 m Olympic champion is often named ``the fastest
man/woman in the world''.
\item The world record is 9.58 seconds.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Higher}
\begin{itemize}
\item The high jump is a track and field event in which competitors
must jump over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without the
aid of certain devices.
\item The world record is 2.45m.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Stronger}
\begin{itemize}
\item Olympic weightlifting, also called Olympic-style weightlifting,
  or weightlifting, is an athletic discipline in the modern Olympic
  programme in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift
  of a barbell loaded with weight plates.
\item The world record is 305 kg, the sum of snatch and clean \& jerk. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Why faster, higher, and stronger?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Faster}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Faster?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many computations are {\em slow}.
\item Many computations are {\em time critical}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Slow Computation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Brute force search
\item Computer simulation
\item Exponential time complexity
\item Grand Challenge problems
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Traveling Salesman} Given a set of cities and the distance
between two cities, find the shortest route that goes through all
cities without visiting any city twice.
\begin{itemize}
\item A famous NP-complete problem, i.e., a proven hard-as-hell
  problem in computer science.
\item Easy, you just permute all cities and find the shortest route.
\item However, the number of permutations is $(n-1)!$ where $n$ is the
  number of cities.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Factorial}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a traveling salesman problem with 101 cities.
\item $100!$ is roughly $9.332621544 \times 10^{157}$.
\item Assume that the computation of the length of a path can be done
  in 100 cycles.
\item Assume that a computer runs at 10 GHz.
\item It takes $9.332621544 \times 10^{146}$ seconds to enumerate all
  paths.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Computation Time}
\begin{itemize}
\item A year has 31,556,926 seconds, so the computation takes $2.9574
  \times 10^{130}$ billion years.
\item The age of earth is 4.54 billion
  years\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth}}.
\item The age of the universe is 13.798 billion
  years\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe}}.
\item Do you honestly think anyone can live to see the results?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Algorithm Optimization} Despite techniques like
branch-and-bound and $A^*$ search can reduce the number of cases one
needs to examine, the sheer number of permutations is enormous.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Discussion} \Large 
\begin{itemize}
\item Give an example of computation that will take a lot of time.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Time Critical Computation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Weather forecast
\item Stock market
\item Radar signal processing
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Worried? Me?}
\begin{itemize}
\item We do not need to do anything because computers become faster
  {\em automatically}!
\item ``Moore's law'' is the observation that, over the history of
  computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated
  circuit doubles approximately every two years\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore\%27s_law}}.
\item If the speed of a CPU is proportional to the number of
  transistors, we expect an eight times speed improvement in six
  years.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Worried? Yes.}
\begin{itemize}
\item We assume we have an $O(n^3)$ ``efficient'' algorithm to solve a
  problem, e.g., matrix multiplication.
\item You can solve problem size twice as large as the original one if
  you wait six years.
\item By the time you wait for the hardware to catch up, your career
  (e.g., as a Ph.D. student) is over.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How to be Faster?}  \Huge Hardware improvement cannot help
you, OK!!  You need better solutions than waiting.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Late Information}
\begin{itemize}
\item Late is {\em not} better than nothing.
\item Justice delayed is justice denied.
\item A weather forecast for tomorrow takes three days.
\item A stock recommendation for next week takes three weeks.
\item The computation of an early warning radar system takes three
  times of the time for an enemy missile to destroy the radar.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How to be Faster?}
\Huge Having more than one CPU to work on the problem seems to be a
  reasonable choice.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Discussion} \Large 
\begin{itemize}
\item Give an example of time-critical computation.
\item Describe Moore's Law.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Better}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Better?}
\begin{itemize}
\item People are {\em greedy}.
\item Video quality is an increasing function of time.
\begin{itemize}
\item VCD (NTSC) $352 \times 240$.
\item DVD (25 frame rate) $720 \times 576$.
\item Blueray (HD) $1920 \times 1080$.
\end{itemize}
\item The number of pixels increases $24.5$ times.
\item An $O(n^2)$ algorithm will have to run $600$ times faster.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Better?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Again, remember that people are {\em greedy}.
\item Remember faster, higher, stronger.
\item We always seek possibility just beyond our capability.
\item We want to live long and prosper (show a Vulcan gesture).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Weather}
\begin{itemize}
\item The weather forecast resolution is proportional to the number of
  cells in the simulation.
\item Taiwan has a length of 394 km and a width of 144 km.
\item The area to simulate is 56736 square km. 
\item Assume that the simulation model is 10 km in height.
\item If the resolution is 1 cubic km, we need 567360 cells.
\item If we refine the resolution to 100 m, the number of cells will be
  567360000.
\item An $O(n^2)$ algorithms will have to run $1000000$ times faster.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Discussion} 
\begin{itemize}
\item A naive matrix multiplication algorithm multiply two matrices of
  size $n$ by $n$ in $O(n^3)$ time.  If we increase the size of the
  matrix $n$ by a factor of 10, the execution time of this naive
  algorithm will roughly be?

  buy.
\item Experiments are {\em dangerous} -- you do not want to have a
  black-hole in your laboratory.

\section{Definitions}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel Computing}  \Huge Use multiple CPU's to solve a
problem faster and/or better.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Parallel Computing?}
\begin{itemize}
\item We want computation to be faster and better.
\item The performance of a single computer is limited, so the only way
  is to have {\em more} computers.
\item We cannot find single core CPU
  anymore\footnote{\url{http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/quickreffam.htm}},
  so it is essential to know how to get performance from a parallel
  computer.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Limits}
\begin{quote}There are technological and physical limits to uni-processor
  performance that cannot be overcome.  For example, clock times cannot
  be smaller than the response time of electronic circuits, which in
  turn are limited by physical laws.\footnote{Pangfeng Liu, The Parallel
    Implementation of N-body Algorithm, Ph.D. dissertation, 1994.}
\end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Moore's Law}
``Moore's law'' is the observation that, over the history of computing
hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit
doubles approximately every two
years.\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore\%27s_law}}
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Fifty Years of Moore's Law}
\begin{itemize}
\item Moore's Law is a direct consequence of the incredible and unique
  scaling heuristics of semiconductor manufacturing: by holding the
  cost per unit area of manufacturing constant\footnote{Chris
    A. Mack, IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,
    Vol. 24, NO. 2, MAY
    2011. \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5696765}}
\item The economic benefits of Moore's Law come from the shrinking of
  the transistor.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Moore's Law can be formulated as a learning curve by plotting
  minimum feature size as a function of cumulative revenue or area of
  silicon produced by the industry on a log-log scale.
\item Moore's Law has kept on a relatively constant learning curve
  until about 1998–2000. The acceleration of this Moore's learning
  curve over the last decade is likely an unsustainable,
  momentum-driven attempt to recapture past revenue growth rates.
\item The industry, and the world, has enjoyed 50 remarkable years of
  Moore's Law. {\em There are unlikely to be many more years left}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Discussion} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Give at least three data points to support the Moore's Law.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

  cache.
\item A memory arbitrator guarantees the consistency of shared memory
  and cache.

\begin{itemize}
\item Intel Many Integrated Core Architecture (MIC) is a coprocessor
  computer architecture developed by Intel incorporating the Larrabee

  research project, and the Intel Single-chip Cloud Computer multicore
  microprocessor\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon_Phi}}.
\item At the International Supercomputing Conference (2012, Hamburg),
  Intel announced the branding of the processor product family as
  Intel Xeon Phi.

\begin{itemize}
\item The cores of Intel MIC are based on a modified version of P54C
  design, used in the original Pentium.
\item The basis of the Intel MIC architecture is to leverage x86
  legacy by creating a x86-compatible multiprocessor architecture that
  can utilize existing parallelization software tools.
\item Having a large number of cores -- for example, 51110P has 60
  cores running at 1.053 GHz.\footnote{\url{http://ark.intel.com/zh-tw/products/71992/Intel-Xeon-Phi-Coprocessor-5110P-8GB-1_053-GHz-60-core}}

\subsection{Multiprocessor}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multiprocessor} 
\begin{itemize}
\item A parallel system consists of {\em multiple} processors.
\item Note that in this course we usually do not distinguish
  ``processor'' and ``cores'', so we do not make a clear distinction
  between ``multiprocessor'' and ``multicore''.
\item The processors are connected by a {\em shared memory}.
\item Since the processors are connected together by a shared memory,
  they communicate with each other by writing and reading the shared

  they communicate with each other by {\em messages}, like making
  phone calls.

\begin{itemize}
\item A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly
  connected computers that work together so that, in many respects,
  they can be viewed as a single
  system.\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster}}
\item Usually the computers are {\em loosely connected}. i.e., they
  are {\em not} connected by fast and expensive network.
\item An economical alternative to those who cannot afford expensive
  parallel computers.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{My Definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item In my humble opinion any computer system that are connected by a
  network, but not a shared memory, can be considered as a cluster.
\item The point is that they do not have shared memory so they can
  only communicate with the network.
\item The network is not necessarily slow -- some networks are
  extremely fast, so the term ``loosely coupled'' may not be true in
  all cases.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Tianhe Cluster}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently the fastest computer on Earth -- 33.86
  petaflops/second.

  (NUDT) in collaboration with the Chinese IT firm
  Inspur.\footnote{\url{http://www.top500.org/featured/top-systems/tianhe-2-milkyway-2-national-university-of-defense/}}
\item A huge cluster consisting of 16,000 computers.  Each computer
  (node) has two Intel Ivy Bridge Xeon processors and three Xeon Phi
  chips. The total number of cores is 3,120,000.

\frametitle{Parallelism} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instruction-level parallelism
\item Data parallelism
\item Task parallelism
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Instruction-level Parallelism} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instructions can be re-ordered and combined into groups which
  are then executed in parallel without changing the result of the
  program.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Data Parallelism}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data parallelism is a form of parallelization of computing
  across multiple processors in parallel computing environments by
  distributing the {\em tasks} across different parallel computing
  nodes.
\item Often in the form of loops.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Data Parallelism Example}
\programlisting{loop}{Data Parallelism}
\begin{itemize}
\item All the assignment can be done in parallel.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Task Parallelism} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Task parallelism is a form of parallelization of computing
  across multiple processors in parallel computing environments by
  distributing the {\em tasks} across different parallel computing
  nodes.
\item Also called functional parallelism.  Often in the form of
  function calls.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Discussion} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Give an example of data parallelism and task parallelism.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dependency Graph}
\begin{itemize}
\item Every node is task.
\item Every edge is a dependency.  This dependency is related to data
  or synchronization.
\item A task can only starts when all tasks that precede it finish,
  i.e., the tasks must be done in a topological sort order.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dependency Graph}
\begin{itemize}
\item We can eat dinner only after we cook it. 
\item We can listen to music only after we turn on the radio.
\item We can go to sleep only after we finis dinner and music.
\item However, we can listen to the music while having dinner.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Wavefront}
\begin{itemize}
\item Task parallelism must respect the dependency in dependency graph.
\item One can image that task parallelism is a series of wave fronts
  in the dependency graph.  
\item We want to {\em increase} the number of tasks per wavefront in
  order to {\em reduce} the number of wavefront.  That is, we want to
  increase the {\em parallelism} of our algorithm so that it takes
  less time to complete.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Discussion} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw the dependency graph of the previous task parallel example.
  You may add a {\em start} node and an {\em end} node to indicate the
  beginning and the end of execution.  Also point out the wavefront
  and dependency in your drawing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Quantities} 
\begin{description}
\item [$P$] The number of processors
\item [$N$] The number of tasks 
\item [$L$] The longest path in the dependency graph
\item [$W$] The maximum number of tasks in a wavefront
\item [$T$] The execution time, assuming that it takes one unit of
  time to finish a task.
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Execution Time} 
\begin{equation}
N \geq T \ge \max(L, {N \over {\min(P, W)}})
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Increase $P$.
\item Increase $W$, i.e., parallelism.
\item Decrease $L$.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Parallel Programming} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Program a parallel system to perform parallel computing.
\item That is why we are here.
\item more about this in the ``Programming Model'' lecture.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Automatic Parallel Programming?} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Can a program convert our sequential programs into parallel
  programs automatically?
\item Apparently not, otherwise we will not be here.
\item Computer scientists have been trying to invent ``smart''
  compiler that automatically does it, but only have limited success.
\item More details in the ``Programming Model'' lecture.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Distributed Computing}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is very often that people talk about parallel and distributed
  computing.
\item For example, the name of my laboratory is ``Laboratory of
  Parallel and Distributed Computing''.
\item Many conferences and journals have both in their titles.
\begin{itemize}
\item IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium
\item IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems
\item Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing
\item IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Difference}
\begin{description}
\item[Parallel Computing] A set of processing unit to work on a job
  {\em at the same time}, i.e., the focus is that the computations is
  {\em temporally} in parallel.
\item[Distributed Computing] A set of processing unit to work on a job
  {\em at different locations}, i.e., the focus is that the
  computations is {\em geographically} distributed.
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Difference}
\begin{itemize}
\item The focus of parallel processing is {\em performance}.  We care
  very much about the speed we can finish a job.
\item The focus of focus processing is {\em reliability}.  We care
  very much about can we finish a job no matter what happens --
  network down, hardware failure, earthquake, Godzilla attacks, etc.

\frametitle{In this Course}
\begin{itemize}
\item This course will focus on performance, so we mostly discuss
  parallel processing, and will briefly discuss distributed processing
  when necessary.
\item Distributed computing has become increasingly popular because of
  cloud computing and big data processing.
\item Nevertheless, the role of parallel processing is still crucial
  since the processing speed is still essential.
\item The focus is to combine the speed of parallel processing and the
  reliability of distributed computing into a ``parallel and
  distributed system''.
